Finally, after avoding the urge to create a website for my projects I am 
trying the open source static website generator jekyll to create pages for my projects and blogs. Yes this is powered by 
&lbrack; Jekyll&rbrack;&lpar;http://jekyll.com&rpar; and I have used Markdown to write this post. It is actually very easy to get started with the Jekyll.
