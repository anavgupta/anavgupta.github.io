A new day. A new post. A new page. New words. New Memories. There is a lot of
today that is new, yet it is the same as yesterday. I slept in the same bed, in
the same room, in the same country, on the same planet. Yet it is different. Today
is different. I am different, you are different, the world is different. We just
don't realize what has changed.

We perceive a change using its intensity and the effect it has on us. Losing
someone close is always difficult and the change it has in our life is felt
instantaneously. But losing your pen is something you don't notice until its need
arises. Losing your pen doesn't really hurts you, but losing someone does.

It's impossible to talk about change and not talking about the Climate change.
First used in 1975, the notion of climate change and global warming has been here
for a while. We all have heard and read about them. Have Seen many news reporters
talk about it. And we aren't really worried about it. We acknowledge it sometimes
but never experience it. Since our life is not life is not directly disrupted by
climate change, we don't really care about it. It has a very diluted indirect
effect on our lives.

It's normal for us to behave in such a way. Our brain likes to conserve the energy
as much as it can. To reduce the cognitive load. As a side effect, we don't really
perceive insignificant changes in our life. It's one of the reasons that we only
recognize the importance of a person when they are gone. It's not something we
can't change. By regularly ceasing for a moment, analyzing our day for what's good
and what's bad. What works and what doesn't. What's changing and what's not.
